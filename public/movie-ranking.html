<hr />

<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen 0</h3>
<p>The anime movie was really nice with a good story and an amazing ending.</p>

<h3>Kimi No Nawa</h3>
<p>Don't even have to say anything. An all time great.</p>

<h3>Top Gun:Maverick</h3>

  I watched this before Top Gun. Have to say, was really good. Wanted to be a
  fighter pilot for a day.
